# Deep-Learning-Projects
Includes my deep learning concepts and scripts on the following topics:

BERT - Includes pretraining code with masked language model and finetuning on sentiment classification

GAN - Includes code for generating facial images

Generators - Includes custom generators for processing big datasets

LSTM - Includes various LSTM based models such as seq2seq encoder decoder, time series forecasting, text summarization, sequential recommendation engine, etc.

Transformers - Includes transformer neural network code for classification of multi buyers in the next month for retail stores

Notes - Includes deep learning and machine learning concepts such as gradient descent, adam optimizer, etc.
